Problem and Proposed Solution
Introduction to the Topic:
For many years now, detectives, investigators and police officers have always relied on simple pen and paper to record their crime reports during crime scene investigations.

Problem/Issue:
This method of reporting will always cause some sort of delay as detectives will have to go back to the office and re-write a formal report into the computer. This delay can lead to inaccuracies in the detectives report because what might be written in their pad paper may not precisely reflect what was on the scene. This is because an individual’s memory may be subject to change. The longer the duration of holding the memory, the more substantial the memory of an incident can change. These inaccuracies may ultimately cause the innocent to be convicted or the guilty to roam free. 

Proposed Solution:
Design and develop a mobile application that can enable detectives and investigators to submit detailed and precise crime reports in real time. The app is capable of taking the actual date and time of the crime because its clocks and calendars are synchronized in real time. It is also capable of recording the location name as well as the exact coordinates of the crime scene because the app has a geolocation capture feature (pending). The app records other basic information such victim’s involved, potential suspects and evidence found.
This app can track the investigation status of criminal cases with logs and also predicts primary suspects. The system is proposed to help the investigators to speed up investigation process and track status of multiple cases at a time. The system keeps logs of a case which includes case summary, people involved, disputes, past criminal history of those involved, Items recovered on scene and other details. All the information added by the investigator will be uploaded to the online database to be accessed everywhere, the investigator will have a unique username and password to upload/access all the information required.
A special feature called the “Serial Killer Detector” matches similar crimes to possibly find a suspect that could potentially be a serial killer. This feature works with a special Android Studio API that investigates suspect’s public Facebook accounts to detect their degree of connection to particular cases such as communication with victims or suspects (pending).
